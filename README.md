# University Next.js Project

This is a Next.js application.

## Project Structure

The main Next.js application is located in the `my-nextjs-app` directory.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# This will automatically install dependencies in both the root and my-nextjs-app directories

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Just run the standard build command from the root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The postinstall script will automatically install dependencies in the my-nextjs-app directory, and the build script will execute the Next.js build process.
